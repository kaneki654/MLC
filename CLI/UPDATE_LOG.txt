# MLCleaner v0.3 - Changelog & Fix Report

## Stability & Logic Refinements (Latest)
- **Toolbox Engine**: Renamed "Large Files" to **SCAN** and expanded scope to **Root-level global search** (starting from `/`).
- **Data Thresholds**: Set a smart discovery range of **50MB to 1TB+** for the SCAN utility.
- **Thread Safety**: Fixed critical `TclError` by adding `winfo_exists` checks, preventing crashes when navigating away during active scans.
- **Terminal Silence**: Suppressed all background command outputs to ensure zero clutter when running as a packaged app.
- **Authentication**: Fixed "Permission Denied" errors by switching to absolute paths and using `tee` for kernel writes.

## Previous Fixes
- **Seamless Auth**: Integrated an in-app Password Dialog using `sudo -S`. No terminal popups.
- **Zero-Lag UI**: 
  - Replaced animated sidebar with a professional **Icon Rail** (optimized for AMD A4).
  - Implemented **Row Pooling** for Task Manager (Process Sentinel) to eliminate flicker.
- **Hyper-Scan v3**:
  - Scans **Global Filesystem** including **Hidden Files** (`.cache`, `.local`).
  - Correct formatting for Terabyte (TB) and Petabyte (PB) data discovery.
- **High Visibility**: Forced **White Text** and **2px Borders** for 100% visibility in Dark Themes.
